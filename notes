Pubcrawler

side goal - how to turn pubcrawler into tool?

first pass - download results - and average over time by country

Data has country (geonames) and infectious disease.

Note that weights are same for all locations mentioned in article.  Algorithm does not use author front matter for location.  Models pseudo absences with boosted regerssion tree.

in 2nd tier, still include population and health spending etc. as predictors because they can be independently important (aside from pubcrawler)
